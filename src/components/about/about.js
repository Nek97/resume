                            <p>
                                I'm Aniello, an Italy based web developer, project manager, and web designer creating awesome and effective websites and web applications for companies of all sizes around the globe. I'm an undergraduate in Computer Science.
                                I've 10 years of experience in software development and I usually spend my time making research and working in the field of IT to continue to grow.<br/>
                                I've started with the basic programming language, like c, java, and Php.
                                My career is started in 2012 with my first website for an enterprise, since of that moment I've started freelancing during my college time, in 2017 I become internal of an enterprise and in 2018 I become the head developer of the company.<br/>
                                When I've understood the computer science was a true passion and not only a work I've left engineering and I've started my university study of computer science, at the same time I've continued to work to a lot of projects alone or as internal, but at the start of 2019 I've applied to the Red Square Team.
                                In most of the projects I was assigned to, I was left free to manage and manage my colleagues until I officially became a project manager within the team, but this did not move me away from programming the most important and critical are assigned to me, as well as the creation of styles as I can faithfully emulate or create an element that is required of me.
                                I'm also involved as a lead developer of Azeroth Shard Launcher.<br/>
                                I always look for perfect, effective, and practical solutions to any potential problem.
                                I love the challenges that programming offers
